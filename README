How to Compile and Run (without typing "./" before the executable):

$ make
$ export PATH="$PATH:."

To Run (Default option values or using options):

$ ./oss
or
$ ./oss -n 10 -m 1

To remove all .o, .dat and the executables:

$ make clean

Comments on page replacement algorithm on both page request schemes:

I found that the page replacement algorithm on the first scheme had more page faults
compared to the second scheme. The number of memory accesses per second was on average
10-100 more using the first scheme than the second, which would be due to the clock 
incrementations and the time it takes to determine a memory address using the second 
scheme compared to the first which simply generates a random number between 0 and
total memory. I adjusted my clock incrementations multiple times, and ultimatley
left it so there would be close to 1000 memory accesses per second but that could 
easily be changed by increasing or decreasing the clock incrementations. For the second
chance algorithm, it is best case if we find a reference bit of zero for a page not
referred to in a while and we can replace that page. Worst case is when all of the reference
bits are set to 1 and degenerates to fifo replacement.

Additional Project Information:

1.I limited my output file to 120,000 lines so the output wouldn't become too large
and I also have the 2 seconds of real time or 100 processes limit.
2.For the current memory layout printing, I display unallocated frames with a period
and allocated frames with + based on what it says to do in the assignment sheet.
3.I implemented synchronization using message queues for each process.
