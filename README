Additional Project Information:

1.I limited my output file to 120,000 lines so the output wouldn't become too large
and I also have the 2 seconds of real time or 100 processes limit.
2.For the current memory layout printing, I display unallocated frames with a period
and allocated frames with + based on what it says to do in the assignment sheet.
